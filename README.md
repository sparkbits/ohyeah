# About the project
This is a small framework for PHP backends that include some repetitive requirements in my projects that I convert into rehusable code. Implement a restfull api, require a persistent config class based on key,values, etc.

## Build With
- 100% PHP development.
# Getting Started
Here explain what do you need to run this program.
## Prerequisites
- PHP 8.1 and above (It should work on PHP 7.x but not tested),
## Installation
No installation is required. Just copy the ohyeah directory in your folder and include the required files you need to use. I recommend to use an autoloader to simplify this task. See my project [adiutor](https://github.com/sparkbits/adiutor)
# Usage
See the documentation of each module. Include explanations and examples.
